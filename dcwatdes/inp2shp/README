ATTENTION: More recent versions of inp2shp may be found in the inptools
package of the ghydraulic project:

http://inptools.epanet.de

To build inp2shp.exe, you
need the EPANET toolkit and
shapelib.

shapelib is available from:
http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/shapelib/index.html

The EPANET toolkit is available from:
http://www.epa.gov/ORD/NRMRL/wswrd/epanet.html

In addition, you have to apply the patches in the patch
folder against the EPANET sources. For details,
see http://sdteffen.de/hydraulik/epanet.html

Tanks that don't have a ground surface defined will be converted
into reservoirs. This is the standard EPANET behaviour.
