To build inp2shp.exe, you
need the EPANET toolkit and
shapelib.

shapelib is available from:
http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/shapelib/index.html

The EPANET toolkit is available from:
http://www.epa.gov/ORD/NRMRL/wswrd/epanet.html

In addition, you have to apply the patches in the patch
folder against the EPANET sources. For details,
