This package contains frontends that allow to feed ESRI Shapefiles
to triangulation packages.

BUILDING

Makefiles are available for MinGW MSYS 1.0.10 (Makefile) and
Microsoft Visual C++ (makefile.msc).

Extract the shapelib distribution to c:\program files\shapelib or
adjust the makefiles.

RUNNING

same folder as the frontends.
